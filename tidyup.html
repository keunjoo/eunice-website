                 TidyUp is a chores checklist app concept. It keeps track of task assignments and frequency of the tasks and enables communication between housemates.

              <p>My housemate and I moved into our new apartment last summer. Soon the time cameâ€”time for chores logistics. Who's doing what, how often, stuff like that. So we sat down and made a Google Spreadsheet with chores as rows and months as columns.</p>
              <p>It wasn't as simple as it seemed. Some tasks had to be done more often than others. We should definitely vacuum the floor and empty the trash bin more often than cleaning the bathtub. So we added nested columns in each month to represent weeks.</p>
              <p>The spreadsheet was already getting pretty complicated. Then another problem arose: We needed another division of columns to rotate tasks. In retrospect, maybe we were a bit too nitpicky about making all this equal and fair, but we both knew that we didn't want the situation where one of us cleans the toilet all the time while the other windexes the bathroom mirror.</p>

          <div class="project-section">
              <div class="project-subheading">Problems & Challenges</div>
              <p>By the time we finished making our spreadsheet, it was quite difficult to follow what was going on. This easily translated into design challenges for the app concept.</p>
           <ul>
               <li>How to display different time intervals</li>
               <li>How to send reminders</li>
               <li>How to display chore info in neat chunks</li>
           </ul>
          </div>
        <div class="project-section">
            <div class="project-subheading">Purpose & Core Functionalities</div>
            <p>The app conceptually fulfills all those needs we realized while making the spreadsheet. Namely,</p>
         <ul>
             <li>Set up home and invite housemates</li>
             <li>Organize and assign tasks</li>
             <li>Set task repetition</li>
             <li>Remind each other of responsibilities <span class="side-note">(we don't like being passive aggressive!)</span></li>
         </ul>
         <span class="side-note">This concept assumes authentication via a Gmail or Facebook account. It also assumes the invitation process in which the initial user sends his/her housemate(s) a link to the app via email or text message.</span>

             <p>The iOS built-in Reminders app has an intuitive interface in which users are able to add, delete, edit, and mark as complete. Since this is a chores list app, which essentially serves a very similar but contexualized function, I took Reminders as an inspiration for the general layout.</p>

        <div class="project-section">
            <div class="project-subheading">Interface Design</div>
            <p>Days, weeks and months are discrete units that can be easily represented with buttons, but there are many different ways in which tasks can be repeated. By adding a numeric stepper, I tried to give the users more flexibility in customizing the frequency of tasks. </p>
